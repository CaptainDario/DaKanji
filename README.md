## What is this

DaKanji helps students of the Japanese language and people who use it.
Currently, it can recognize 6500+ characters (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana, Romaji, Arabic Numbers) which the user draws by hand.
But the feature set will be vastly improved in the coming releases. <br/>
For more details about the features take a look at the [usage section](#usage).
</br>

## What the users say

* "Your program is like magic! Thank you so much!" - saszai2
* "Well thank you for this software! It seems to try and guess in a more "guess-y" way than jisho and even Google which is usually pretty good at guessing, and it just saved me today!" - princess_daphie
* "Amazing. I can write kanji messier than a professor and it still picks it up. Very reliable." - Seth Kitchens

## Getting started

The easiest way is to download the app for android from the PlayStore.
You can also download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/CaptainDario/DaKanji-Mobile/releases).
## Usage

In this section the features of the app are explained in more detail.

### Handwritten kanji recognition

The user can draw a character in the UI and the app will predict which character was drawn.
This prediction can then be opened in a dictionary of choice. A dictionary can be chosen in the settings.
Those dictionaries include translation apps, app dictionaries, and web dictionaries.</br>
Currently, 6500+ characters are supported. 
All supported characters can be found [here](https://github.com/CaptainDario/DaKanji-Mobile/blob/main/assets/labels_CNN_kanji_only.txt).</br>
