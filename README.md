## What the users say

* "Your program is like magic! Thank you so much!" - saszai2
* "Well thank you for this software! It seems to try and guess in a more "guess-y" way than jisho and even Google which is usually pretty good at guessing, and it just saved me today!" - princess_daphie
* "Amazing. I can write kanji messier than a professor and it still picks it up. Very reliable." - Seth Kitchens

All contributions are welcome!
Here is a list of things that would help this project:

* Testing! You cannot believe how much this helps out, DaKanji became quite a big project and many things go unnoticed. For testing (beta) releases please join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/cYTcpFStbs) and ask in the "become a tester"-channel (or take a look at the release section there could be a pre-release available). All testing is much appreciated!
* If you have ideas how to improve this app or you found a bug please [open an issue](https://github.com/CaptainDario/DaKanji-Mobile/issues).
* Of course you can become involved in this project, head over to discord and ask what a great feature to work on would be or take a look at [issues labeled as 'good first issue'](https://github.com/CaptainDario/DaKanji/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
* Or if you like this project, giving it a star or rating it on the store of your platform would also help immensely
