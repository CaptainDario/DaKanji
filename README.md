## What is this

DaKanji helps students of the Japanese language and people who use it.

The current feature set:

* Recognize hand drawn single characters (Kana, 6500+ Kanji)
* Available for Android, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Windows

But this is only the beginning, in the coming months the feature list will keep growing.

## What the users say

* "Your program is like magic! Thank you so much!" - saszai2
* "Well thank you for this software! It seems to try and guess in a more "guess-y" way than jisho and even Google which is usually pretty good at guessing, and it just saved me today!" - princess_daphie
* "Amazing. I can write kanji messier than a professor and it still picks it up. Very reliable." - Seth Kitchens

## Usage

All major parts of the app include a tutorial.
But if you want to learn more or prefer a text guid,
  take a look at the [manual](./manual/manual.md) or open the manual screen in the app.
