1	"Irregular conjugation.  Note that this not the same as the definition
 of ""irregular verb"" commonly found in textbooks (typically する and
 来る).  It denotes okurigana that is different than other words of
 the same class.  Thus the past tense of 行く (行った) is an irregular
 conjugation because other く (v5k) verbs use いた as the okurigana for
 this conjugation.  します is not an irregular conjugation because if
 we take する to behave as a v1 verb the okurigana is the same as other
 v1 verbs despite the sound change of the stem (す) part of the verb
 to し."
2	na-adjectives and nouns are usually used with the なら nara conditional, instead of with であれば de areba. なら is a contracted and more common form of ならば.
3	では is often contracted to じゃ in colloquial speech.
4	The (first) non-abbreviated form is obtained by applying sequentially the causative, then passive conjugations.
5	The -まい negative form is literary and rather rare.
6	The ら is sometimes dropped from -られる, etc. in the potential form in conversational Japanese, but it is not regarded as grammatically correct.
7	"'n' and 'adj-na' words when used as predicates are followed by the
 copula <a href=""entr.py?svc=jmdict&sid=&q=2089020.jmdict"">だ</a> which is what is conjugated (<a href=""conj.py?svc=jmdict&sid=&q=2089020.jmdict"">conjugations</a>)."
8	'vs' words are followed by <a href="entr.py?svc=jmdict&sid=&q=1157170.jmdict">する</a> which is what is conjugated (<a href=""conj.py?svc=jmdict&sid=&q=1157170.jmdict"">conjugations</a>).
