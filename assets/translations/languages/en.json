This means that the query 'taberu' will be converted to \u305f\u3079\u308b and will find \u98df\u3079\u308b, but it can also lead to unintended matches.\n\nFor example searching 'man' will be converted to \u307e\u3093 and therfore, matches \u4e07 and the english word 'man'.\n\nNote: this is a global setting and is applied everywhere the dictionary is used",

This word frequency is an estimation of a word's usage and is based on different data sources:\n\n* Wikipedia, representing encyclopedic text\n* Subtitles, from OPUS OpenSubtitles 2018 and SUBTLEX\n* Web text, from OSCAR\n* Twitter, representing short-form social media\n* Reddit, representing potentially longer Internet comments\n\nThe number shown in DaKanji is a variation on the actual word frequency called [Zipf frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) that aims to return the word frequency on a human-friendly logarithmic scale. The Zipf frequency of a word is the base-10 logarithm of the number of times it appears per billion words. A word with Zipf value 6 appears once per thousand words, for example, and a word with Zipf value 3 appears once per million words.\nReasonable Zipf values are between 0 and 8, but the minimum Zipf value appearing in DaKanji is 1.0. We use 0 as the default Zipf value for words that do not appear in the data sources, although it should mean one occurrence per billion words.\n[Read more...](https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq)",
