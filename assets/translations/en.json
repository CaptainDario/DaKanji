The Zipf frequency of a word is the base-10 logarithm of the number of times it appears per billion words. A word with Zipf value 6 appears once per thousand words, for example, and a word with Zipf value 3 appears once per million words.\nReasonable Zipf values are between 0 and 8, but the minimum Zipf value appearing in DaKanji is 1.0. We use 0 as the default Zipf value for words that do not appear in the data sources, although it should mean one occurrence per billion words.\n[Read more...](https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq)",
