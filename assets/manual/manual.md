# Drawing Screen - Hand drawn character recognition

The user can draw a character in the UI and the app will predict which character was drawn.
This prediction can then be opened in a dictionary of choice. A dictionary can be chosen in the settings.
Those dictionaries include translation apps, app dictionaries, and web dictionaries.</br>
Currently, 6500+ characters are supported.
All supported characters can be found [here](https://github.com/CaptainDario/DaKanji-Mobile/blob/main/assets/labels_CNN_kanji_only.txt).
